# Project ROCKET
Project ROCKET is a simple game built in Unity where the player controls a rocket and tries to navigate through obstacles to reach a landing square. The objective is to complete each level as quickly as possible, with the time taken serving as the score.

# Gameplay
The game controls are as follows:

Press the Space key to boost the rocket forward.
Use the A and D keys to rotate the rocket left and right, respectively.
The player needs to carefully time the boosts and rotations to navigate through the obstacles successfully. Landing on the designated square at the end of each level will complete it and unlock the next level.

# Levels
The game consists of multiple levels that progressively increase in difficulty. Each level introduces new obstacles and challenges for the player to overcome. As you complete each level, you will lend in the next one will automatically.

# Scoring
The player's score is determined by the time taken to complete each level. The faster you complete a level, the higher your score will be. The goal is to achieve the best possible time for each level and aim for a high overall score.
